Initial sequence number is always 0 as a reference:
So it seq=0 goes from sender to receiver and receiver asks this seq=0 with his own seq=0 and also indicated that he is expecting next sequence number=1 by setting that value to ack flag/packet.

Sender----> seq=0====>        Receiver.
Sender<==== seq=0, ack=1<==== Receiver.
Sender ======> Ack=1=======>  Receiver.
